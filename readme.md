# Code Statistics IntelliJ Plugin

This is an IntelliJ IDEA plugin that calculates and displays code statistics in real-time for Java files. The plugin shows the total number of lines, classes, interfaces, methods, variables, comments, and the average method length in the currently open Java file. Statistics are updated live as you edit your code.
